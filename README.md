# Image_Classification_Innovative_Method

Image classification is a supervised learning problem. By having a set of different categorized images we can train a model in order to label any input picture so, our model will be capable of detecting that our given image belongs to which class we defined.

Despite of other architectures that have been used for classification, we have innovated a new method and model in which one can classify the pictures the same way but in higher accuracy.

# DATASET
CIFAR10 dataset has been applied which one can check it out here.

# TRAIN
In this project, we have first classified images into two categories: Animal, Vehicle. Then these images were categorized in their main labels like frogs, ships, and so forth.
By doing this we reached a higher average accuracy resulting in how better it would be if one first modularize its dataset and then train it.

This kind of modularization may help many models and projects as well as our's in accuracy.
I have also uploaded the old method which were mostly used.

# RESULT
We ended having 65% accuracy by the old used method and architecture of this classification; however, With the new method we have achieved 95% accuracy in the first step and 71.5 accuracy in followed steps which means on average, we have gained a better accuracy.
