# Image_Classification_Innovative_Method

Image classification is a supervised learning problem. By having a set of different categorized images we can train a model in order to label any input picture so, our model will be capable of detecting that our given image belongs to which class we defined.

Despite of other architectures that have been used for classification, we have innovated a new method and model in which one can classify the pictures the same way but in higher accuracy.

# DATASET
CIFAR10 dataset has been applied which one can check it out here.

# TRAIN
In this project, we have first classified images into two categories: Animal, Vehicle. Then these images were categorized in their main labels like frogs, ships, and so forth.
By doing this we reached a higher average accuracy resulting in how better it would be if one first modularize its dataset and then train it.


I have also uploaded the old method which were mostly used.
